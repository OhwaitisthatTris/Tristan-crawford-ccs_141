If I had unlimited power and knowledge in programming, i would try to make my own world.
I would create a virtual enviroment where I could simulate real life things that can/could happen in the real world.
It would be limited only by imagination and creativity. I would control the weather, the seasons, even how the 
ocean waves crash against the shore. I would create a world where people can create their own stories and adventures,
and where they can learn and grow from their experiences.
