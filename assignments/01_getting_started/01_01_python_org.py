"""

I looked through phython.org and found information about the latest version of Python and its features. 
If I had great programming skills, i would first write a script to scrape the website for updated versions of phython.
After it retrieves the latest version, it would then compare it to the currently installed version on my machine and
 notify me if an update is available. This would keep me focused on making a new project without worrying about bugs
and failed installations due to outdated software.
